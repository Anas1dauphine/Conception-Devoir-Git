# Devoir Git

this project contains the files from R1 repository with all the manipulations of the different files

### Remote repository

Predict what master and origin/master refer to in R2, and check. What is in the file bold.txt in R2? Why?

```
in R2 the branch doesn't take the changes of the bold.txt file from the R1 repository , because R2 didn't get merged with the new updates. The R2 repository is considered as another user, so since this user don't push the changes, he can't see the updates 
```

### Remote repository on GitHub

Modify something in R1, commit. Try to send it to RG. Why is it refused? How can you effectively send your last modification online? Send it on your RG repository.

```
after modifying the file in R1 repository we cannot push it to the github, because it doesn't contain the new modifications of the bold files pushed before from R3. the solution is to pull the modifications from github, then change them and then push back to github
